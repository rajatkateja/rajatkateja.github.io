Hi, I am Rajat Kateja!
</p>

I am a software engineer at Google. Prior to that, I graduated with a MS and PhD from CMU. Even before that, I completed my BTech from IIT Guwahati. 

One of my favourite things in grad school was reading papers, synthesizing them, thinking about how they are related, and writing about them (I loved writing the related works sections!) I started this blog/website to try and keep up the habit of reading and writing, and hopefully learn new things. 

If you like what you read here and/or want to share your thoughts on a paper, consider 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/afterhoursacademic-subscribers">subscribing</a> or 
following me on <a href="http://twitter.com/rajatkateja">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/rajatkateja">LinkedIn</a>
to get notified of new posts (typically once a week).
