Hi, I am Rajat Kateja! I am a member of technical staff at <a href="https://alcion.ai">Alcion</a>. 
I have a PhD from Carnegie Mellon University and my favourite part in grad school was reading and 
synthesizing papers and writing related works sections. This blog is an attempt to 
keep up the habit of reading and writing about computer systems research.
