Hi, I am Rajat Kateja!
<br><br>
I am a software engineer at Google. Prior to that, I graduated with a MS and PhD from CMU. Even before that, I completed my BTech from IIT Guwahati. 
<br><br>
One of my favourite things in grad school was reading papers, synthesizing them, thinking about how they are related, and writing about them (I loved writing the related works sections!) I started this blog/website to try and keep up the habit of reading and writing, and hopefully learn new things.
